            Making it the most powerful production muscle car ever. That's thanks to 840bhp and 770lb ft of torque from the supercharged 6.2-litre HEMI V8. And before you start commenting that it's just a Hellcat engine turned up, it's not. 

The Demon's V8 has 25 major component upgrades including a new, larger supercharger (2.7 litres vs. 2.4 litres), new pistons, rods, valve train andfuel injection system, as well as increased boost pressure (14.5psi vs 11.6psi) and a higher rpm limit (6,500rpm vs 6,200rpm).

        <p>
            The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of automobiles (two of those being pony cars) produced by American automobile manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge was in 1959 for marketing a "value version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.
        </p>

            Overview
        </h1>
        <p>
            Kneeling at the altar of horsepower is the growling 1025-hp Dodge SRT Challenger Demon 170—a machine built by blood and iron in Ontario, Canada. The street-legal drag-strip special looks a lot like the previous Demon (limited to a one-year run for 2018), but this time Dodge's development team has completed all the necessary rituals to summon a four-digit horsepower figure from the pinnacle of the brand’s iconic Hellcat V-8. The steroidal supercharged 6.2-liter needs E85 gasoline to make full power, and that 170-proof ethanol fuel mixture inspires its namesake. Even with 91-octane gas, the 170 still makes an insane 900 horses. The 2023 Demon 170 is simply an outrageous send-off to what were already some of the wildest muscle cars on the planet.
        </p>
        <h1>
            Engine, Transmission and Performance
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Demon 170's most devilish detail is under the hood. Bolted between its fenders is a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 with so many internal improvements versus its predecessor that the only thing the two engines share is a camshaft. Burning E85, the 170’s mill produces 1025 horsepower and 945 pound-feet of torque. If that’s not available at the pump, 91-octane will provide 900 horses and 810 pound-feet. The reinforced and upgraded parts spread to the driveline where there’s a stronger driveshaft and beefier rear axle. Gearchanges are still handled by an eight-speed automatic, and a new and improved transmission brake brings configurable launch settings. The Demon 170 rolls on Mickey Thompson ET Street R tires, size 245/55R-18 in front and a gigantic 315/50R-17 out back. Dodge claims it eked out a quarter-mile time of 8.61 seconds at 151 mph but needed a prepped surface to do it. Same for its 60-mph claim of 1.66 seconds. We haven't yet tested the new Demon 170 (and we may never get the chance to), but we'll update this space if we do.
